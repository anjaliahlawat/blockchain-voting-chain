# blockchain-voting-system
The project aims to build a web app combined with a blockchain technology to present a better system for voting online.
It's a web app to perform online voting. The user like in general will register and form an account and at the time of voting , the 
register user will login into his account and will vote. The process of blockchain lies in the backend. Each vote with all the relevant 
details of user who voted will form a block and as no. of users vote , these blocks will form a blockchain. 
It uses hyperledger(a private blockchain) to form a blockchain of votes so as to keep voting in a private network only. 
Each vote is like a transaction in a public blockchain network. It also makes use of machine learning to validate a vote. 
To validate each vote, face detection by ML algorithms will be used to add more security to the system.
